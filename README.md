# Knowledge Representation of a Monster World
There are monsters with certain elemental types and attack moves. Each move has an elemental type of its own. These attack moves have different effectiveness on different monsters, all dependent on the elemental type. For example,

Monster A of type **water** has an attack move called "water gun". This move is of type **water**.
Monster B of type **fire** has an attack move called "flamethrower". This move is of type **fire**.

If Monster A performs "water gun" on Monster B, it will have super effectiveness.
If Monster B performs "flamethrower" on Monster A, it will have weak effectiveness.

This Knowledge Base covers the above, as well as which monsters have which moves.
